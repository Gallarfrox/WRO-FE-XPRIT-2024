## Chasis
 
 The Chasis of our robot are 3D printed Parts that were designed using SolidWorks and Tinkercad. All 3D models are in [**3D design Folder.**](https://github.com/Gallarfrox/WRO-FE-XPRIT-2024/tree/8289e319c8ed50b18eef6a841f7b57f9364190d7/3D%20Desings)
## Power Supply

The power supply utilized is a 2000mAh 7V Li-Po battery. Additionally, we employ an LM7805 voltage regulator to stabilize the power supplied to our boards and microcontrollers.
## Mobility And Direction

For Direction we use a Servo attached a 3D printed piece with two wheels in the sides. For Forward and Backwards movement we use a "L" shaped dc Motor.
## Electronic Schematics

Our Electronic Schematics and Codes we use are in [**SRC folder.**](https://github.com/Gallarfrox/WRO-FE-XPRIT-2024/tree/fe686a653da6ce5ed55e57e9bf3dd3e55d9c889c/SRC)
