## Chassis
 
 The Chassis of our robot are 3D printed Parts that were designed using SolidWorks and Tinkercad. All 3D models are in [**3D design Folder.**](https://github.com/Gallarfrox/WRO-FE-XPRIT-2024/tree/8289e319c8ed50b18eef6a841f7b57f9364190d7/3D%20Desings)
## Power Supply

The power supply utilized is a 370mAh 11.1V Li-Po battery. Additionally, we employ an LM7805 voltage regulator to stabilize the power supplied to our boards and microcontrollers.
## Mobility And Direction

To control direction, 
Our robot is designed with one DC motor and a single servo motor, chosen for their ease of replacement in Argentina also for its easy implementation. We use a custom 3D-printed part to enhance the steering of the front wheels, using the Ackerman Method for optimal maneuverability. The two wheels are directly attached to the DC motor, creating a compact and agile design. The robot follows the circuit’s external walls, ensuring an optimal turning radius and quick response time.
## Electronic Schematics
